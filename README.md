# ExtraaEdge_Assignment

- I have uploaded the project as .zip file as I am not extensive user of github. I am more familier with Visual Studio's TFS for version control.
- I have successfully implemented the most of the modules that you have asked me to do.
- I failed to implement the authentication module. I managed to create a JWT toke and api for same is added in the project, but for some reason my token couldn't get validated. The username and password to generate token is 'dummy'.
- Also I failed to implement unit test cases as I am new to that as well. But given an opportunity, I can pick it up real quick.
